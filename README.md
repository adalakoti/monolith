# monolith

Heptio Monolith is an open source repository that is designed at being a working resource to help understand what it takes to migrate large, monolithic, legacy applications to Kubernetes.

### Community Calls

We host community calls where we come together to look at various efforts around this movement.
These are calls that are open to anyone, and we can bring any agenda item up on the call.

You can join the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/monolithic-apps-to-k8s) to get calendar invitations for the call.

We also have a channel `#monolith` in the [official Kubernetes slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2heptio-monolith).

##### The Video Calls

All of the sessions can be found in the [Heptio Community Calls playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvmPtYZtoXOG4dgpYIU2OJuDryMhEYyPw)

### The Application(s)

We currently have 1 prototype application in the `/application` directory.
This plays the role of a hard-to-manage Java application that we try to run (well) in Kubernetes.
